UFO Sightings


A task was performed to create a site that allows users to filter UFO sightings. The first part involved making a filter for rows based on
values from the 'date/time' column. The followup built on this by making a multi-choice filter that narrowed search results for rows based
on values from the 'data/time', 'city', 'state', 'country', and 'shape' columns.
